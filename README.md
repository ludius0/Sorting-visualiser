# Sorting-visualiser

Sorting visualiser made in pygame. Some time ago I wrote on my to-do project list project, which would show how sorting algorithms works and also I would learn more about sorting algorithm. Also I remember, before I started, I once saw code from user fraserlove, who made in really good OOP style (I wasn't experienced enough with OOP -> after this project I am more confident about it), so I tried it also in OOP as challange and I'm happy with result.

NOTE: STILL WORKING ON IT
